## Description

This is a udacity project on the topic "Unreal and VR". In this game the player (as VR pawn) has to catch plates which were thrown by a "malfunctioning" plate warmer. The player's goal is to catch those plates before they hit any solid object and "wash" them in the sink. Every plate that was successfully placed in the sink is counted as score, which is visible as pile in proximity to the player. 
The game can be startet and stopped with a big red button. Anyway, the game's duration is limited to 45 seconds per play. The player is informed with sound cues for:
- the start
- every new plate thrown 
- every plate crashed
- every plate washed
- the last 10 seconds
- the end of game

## Software and Hardware

The project was conducted with the Unreal Engine 4.15.3, the Oculus Audio Plugin and some additional ".wav files" downloaded from www.freesound.org, and http://www.grsites.com/archive/sounds, respectively. The environment was provided by udacity's project team "Learn Unreal VR Foundations" as template. Additional assets (plate warmer, crashed plate and hands) were designed by the project team with ZBrush 4R8 and Maya 2018.
The project has been tested with the HTC Vive, but should work with the Oculus Rift as well.
